        <h2> <span>  Applications </span>  of Steel Structures</h2>

      <p>
        In contemporary construction practices, steel structures have become integral across diverse applications, encompassing high-rise buildings, industrial complexes, airports, infrastructure projects, and equipment supports on a global scale.
      </p>

      <h3>Suitable for large-scale projects that require high durability, such as:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Industrial Buildings, Factories, and Workshops:</strong>
          <p>
            Industrial building frames, designed for tall structures and heavy loads, predominantly utilize steel or a combination of steel columns, reinforced concrete, and steel beams.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Large-Span Structures:</strong>
          <p>
            Ideal for constructions requiring substantial spans of 30-40 meters, such as performance halls, sports arenas, exhibition halls, and aircraft hangars. In cases of exceptionally vast spans exceeding 100 meters, steel structures emerge as the sole viable choice.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Multi-Storey Buildings:</strong>
          <p>
            Particularly advantageous for high-rise structures in urban landscapes. Steel structures offer benefits over reinforced concrete for buildings exceeding 15 floors.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Road Bridges and Railways:</strong>
          <p>
            Employed in steel construction when moderate to extensive spans are required, emphasizing swift construction. Steel suspension bridges, for instance, can gracefully span distances exceeding 1000 meters.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>High-Rise Installations: Electric Towers, Antennas:</strong>
          <p>
            Used in structures like electric poles, wireless antenna poles, and specialized constructions such as oil drilling towers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Platform Structures:</strong>
          <p>
            Applied in contexts like oil and gas storage tanks, high-temperature equipment within chemical plants, and oil refineries.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This extensive versatility positions steel structures as a cornerstone in modern construction, addressing a spectrum of engineering needs with resilience and efficiency.
